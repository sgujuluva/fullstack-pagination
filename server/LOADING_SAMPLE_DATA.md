# Loading the sample data from MongoDB Atlas

Before we can begin, we will load a sample dataset to work with.

MongoDB Atlas provides multiple sample datasets, with sample data for us.

1. Log into your MongoDB account
   
2. In your main control panel, click on Clusters
   
3. Click on the 3 dots (...) and click on 'Load Sample Dataset'

4. Follow the on screen instructions

> Note: It may take up to 15 minutes for the dataset to completely load

After this, you should have some new databases / collections:

    - sample_airbnb
    - sample_analytics
    - sample_geospatial
    - sample_mflix
    - sample_restaurants
    - sample_supplies
    - sample_training
    - sample_weatherdata
